	- Talked to Omin who gave us the job and left (he thinks we are great adventurers)
		- The Waterdeep guard has tasked Acquisitions Inc to invesigate
		- Some people went to investigate and disappeared 
	- Jim Darkmagic then showed up and told us that we should just do the job
- Tarp tried to get a loan from Liri but she doesn't trust him yet
- Tarp was racially profiling Liri and thought she was a criminal (she would never)
- We bought some "health" potions from a shady gnome (Jerr) who also agreed to give us information for pay 
- The information was shit so Liri stole the money back 
- We continued on and got surrounded by dude who tried to mug us ("Your money or your life")

- We done killed them and took the guys toes and head 
- We went back to the gnome and the little bitch ran (we stole all his stand's shit)
- We heard a scuffle and saw two people kidnapping an old man 
- We saved the old man and he was kinda insane but then started saying some speech:
	- Kal's Response: Kal's eyes come into focus and he becomes as sober as a priest of Ilmater at sunup. "Their plans are afoot," he whispers. "Their staff are ready. Their balance sheets are totaled, and that total is grim. They mean to bring the end of all things! You must seek the magic! Only you can stop them! Only you! You... are who again, sorry?"
- We continue on towards the rift and see a drunk dude

- We arrive at a room 
- The room has pools of liquid that all look different and a big lock is on the door
	- The lock is very fancy, there are runes on it 
	- Drawings on the walls show robed figures submerging themselves in the pools 
- Fish boy fully submerges himself in the pool, he feels like he's burning in acid
	- He toughs it out and gains resistance to acid damage 
- Liri tried and failed to pick the lock 
	- Everyone but Liri turned into poison snakes and we had to fight

- The hallway has a bunch of rune traps 
- We break down the door and get attacked by a bunch of zombies 
	- Beef goes down (Saves: 2 fail, 0 success)
	- Liri fed him some of the shitty health potion and he got 1 hp (potion was diluted goodberry)
