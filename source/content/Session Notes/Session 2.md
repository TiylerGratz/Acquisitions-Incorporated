- Started by talking to Gorkho 
	- His friend (Caerhan Colesmith) and him were traveling to find some sort of lost shrine thing to find a lost relic thing 
	- Some sort of broken clock? 
	- Trying to destroy the relic because it killed all of their party members 
		- They dont know how, just think that it is evil and needs to be destroyed
		- Party members got killed a couple weeks ago 
	- He went down here a few days ago 
- Tarp asked Gorkho to join us and is attempting to un-racist himself 
	- Gorkho likes us 
- Arrive at the next room 
	- Big ol granite block is hung from the ceiling, it is carved into a foot
	- There are runes on the walls of a bear footprint 
	- There are rotting severed humanoid feet around the room, there is no blood 
- There is apparently rumors about a serial killer in Waterdeep who takes peoples feet
- Another pair of feet materialized into the room and fell into the pile 
- We moved through the room and the feet attacked up 
	- Tarp greased up the feet 
- The big foot made of granite kicked Liri
- We killed all the feet 
- We find out that the runes are activated/deactivated by placing your foot into the rune 
- We continue down the tunnels 
	- Dirty brown water comes from pipes in the ceiling into a cesspool in the middle (sewage)
- There was a random experiment that a lord of Waterdeep did
	- They made a cesspool to drain into the plane of filth to get rid of the city's sewage
		- The plan was abandoned but we don't remember why 
- The water is rippling 
	- The creature is big and round and long 
- We throw a rope with some fabric on it to try fish for the fucker 
- It is a big tentacle
	- Combat time 
- Tarp is racist yet again 
	- Said that Liri would be familiar with the dimension of filth (likely because she is a raccoon)
- We kill the tentacle and continue onward
- We hear noises that sound like critters 
	- Sounds like decent sized claws scratching against a rock
	- Bigger than Liri, smaller than Beef 
	- Snapping/Biting sounds (coming up empty)
- See a little brass dragon stuck underneath some rocks trying to fend off the flying squid creatures 
	- Combat with 2 dark mantles 
	- They ink all over the place 
- We killed the squids and helped the dragon out 
- Dragon's name is Dabshabah
	- Was being hunted by a "big scary green dragon" and fled to the tunnels 
	- Got stuck 
- She asked to come with us 
	- We took a short rest to let her heal
- Liri and Tarp each give the dragon one of their rations
- We continue onto the next room 
	- There is an alter against the far wall
	- There is a big gear mechanism with a giant hammer 
	- 20 foot tall room 
	- On the floor near the alter is a golden device resembling a clock thing (orrery)
	- The device is battered and falling apart 
	- The corpse of a dwarf is next to it (Gorkoh's friend)
	- The wall to the left of the alter, the wall is collapsed 
	- A woman (wearing city guard uniform, Sergent Teeshe) stands facing the corner 
		- She is likely not in control of her mental state (possession, mind control, etc)
	- A lot of runes on the alter (probably related)
		- The shrine doesn't seem to be connected to any well-known gods but seems to be related to destruction magic 
	- The guard lady walked past Dabshabah a couple days ago and looked fine 
- Gonna have Dabshabah try to sleep breath the Sergent Teeshe
	- It worked and we took her weapons
- Tarp goes to examine the dwarf's body and the hammer mechanism tries to swing at him 
	- He dodges it but combat starts
- Tarp greased himself up yet again (greasy greasy boy)
- Dabshabah melts the hammer on the mechanism and ends the combat
- Teeshe breaks out of her ropes and attacks 
	- Gorkoh knocks her out (Yay Gorkoh)
- Beef tried to grab the hammer from the alter and gets possessed 
	- Dabshabah puts him to sleep 
- Tarp and Liri try to break the alter 4 times and barely do shit
	- Beef wakes up and is no longer possessed and smashed the shit out of it 
- We wrap the broken clock thing in cloth and put it in our bag 
- We started to head out of the caves and Teeshe woke up
	- She doesn't remember anything past entering the caves 
- Dabshabah started getting a headache 
	- Waterdeep has an anti-dragon spell on it so Dabashah has to dig out separately 
	- We agree to meet her outside the northern gate of the city 
- We head back out of the hole 
- Captain Truff meets us outside it and said that we took 4 days to clear the place 
- They take inventory of everything we got in there but do not take it 
- A bunch of thugs show up and try to steal our shit 
	- We are kinda getting fucked 
	- The drunk halfling shows up with a hand crossbow
	- Combat ended (We only won because of Tommy's mercy)
- Teeshe died in the fight (RIP)
- We find out that the halfling's name is Odis
	- He says that he helped us because he was watching us and he works for an organization that likes to keep tabs on things and thwart evil plots in Waterdeep
	- He wasn't actually drunk before
	- Says that the thugs who attacked us were likely apart of the Xanathar Guild
	- We show him the symbol on the skull and he doesn't know anything about it 
- Long rest wah fuckin hoo
- We go to talk with Omin yet again 
	- He talks about Phandelin 
	- They said they gave a headquarters to a group there who missed their last payment
	- He is tasking us with going and investigating the franchise 
		- If they really fucked it we might be able to take over 
	- He believes in us :)
- Sold a bunch of our shit 
- Got the sword and the clock identified
	- The sword is a +1 longsword 
	- The clock is "interesting"
		- Magically repairs itself 
		- Very powerful
		- Seems to be missing components (6 spots around a hexagon where another piece would fit into it)
		- Properties (when attuned): 
			- +1 bonus to AC
			- Proficiency in Arcana
			- Can cast detect magic with it (1/day)
			- Walking speed increases by 10 feet 
		- Required a blood sacrifice (for detect magic)
			- Have to use a bonus action to draw 1d4 damage worth of blood to use 
		- Seems like it compels you to engage in planar travel 
			- The more exciting and dangerous the better
		- Slowly turns you chaotic neutral 
		- If the missing components are found it will probably get stronger 
- Tarp used to jump a lot 
	- He jumped out of the plane of existence that he was in 
	- Tarp likes oiled up feet flopping around 
- Downtime (2 weeks)
	- Liri went gambling and lost 30 gold
	- Tarp went to research the clock thing more 
		- Learns two pieces of lore: 
			- Name: Orrery of the Wanderer
			- While the pieces can be separated, it has the ability to still rebuild itself 
		- Tarp destroyed multiple library shelves and is now banned until he makes amends 
- We head to Phandelin and go to meet up with Dabshabah again 
- Find a lizardfolk who is being threatened 
	- Tarp has not learned his lesson and is racist against the bugbear (character development down the drain)
		- "Not a fan of bugbears"
- Tarp is going to try and talk it out 
	- They told him to "fuck off"
	- They told him to walk away or face the wrath of the Zhentarim
- They wanna fight
	- Tarp obliterated the "black" one (the one in black leather but that's not how he worded it)
	- We killed them without taking any damage
