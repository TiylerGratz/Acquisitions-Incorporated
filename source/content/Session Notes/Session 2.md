- Started by talking to Gorkho 
	- His friend (Caerhan Colesmith) and him were traveling to find some sort of lost shrine thing to find a lost relic thing 
	- Some sort of broken clock? 
	- Trying to destroy the relic because it killed all of their party members 
		- They dont know how, just think that it is evil and needs to be destroyed
		- Party members got killed a couple weeks ago 
	- He went down here a few days ago 
- Tarp asked Gorkho to join us and is attempting to un-racist himself 
	- Gorkho likes us 
- Arrive at the next room 
	- Big ol granite block is hung from the ceiling, it is carved into a foot
	- There are runes on the walls of a bear footprint 
	- There are rotting severed humanoid feet around the room, there is no blood 
- There is apparently rumors about a serial killer in Waterdeep who takes peoples feet
- Another pair of feet materialized into the room and fell into the pile 
- We moved through the room and the feet attacked up 
	- Tarp greased up the feet 
- The big foot made of granite kicked Liri
- We killed all the feet 
- We find out that the runes are activated/deactivated by placing your foot into the rune 
- We continue down the tunnels 
	- Dirty brown water comes from pipes in the ceiling into a cesspool in the middle (sewage)
- There was a random experiment that a lord of Waterdeep did
	- They made a cesspool to drain into the plane of filth to get rid of the city's sewage
		- The plan was abandoned but we don't remember why 
- The water is rippling 
	- The creature is big and round and long 
- We throw a rope with some fabric on it to try fish for the fucker 
- It is a big tentacle
	- Combat time 
- Tarp is racist yet again 
	- Said that Liri would be familiar with the dimension of filth (likely because she is a raccoon)
- We kill the tentacle and continue onward
