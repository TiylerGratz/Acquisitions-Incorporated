- We enter Phandalin (3rd week of employment) and see some sort of stage set up with a large group around it 
- They are RACIST and say that we must be murderers based on just seeing us (apparently adventurers have not been good to this town)
- They are debating for the spot of mayor
- They finish up their debate and we go to find Sildar (the not racist one)
	- We talk to him and he says how Harbin (the racist one) owns a lot of land in the area 
	- Says how Halia went missing which caused the government to change to a council of 5 and a mayor 
	- The other Acq Inc franchise (Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose) moved in a while ago and were operating out of the Tresendar Manor 
		- About a week ago seemed to be some sort of fight going on (explosions, fighting, etc) and the manor was up in flames 
		- Didn't see who was fighting 
		- The town is not very happy with adventures 
		- He walked up there after a couple days and only found rubble, blood, scorch marks, and remnants of what they had been building 
	- The mines are currently down because of monster attacks. Harbin likes to blame the monster attacks on adventurers 
- We look at the Shrine of Luck 
	- There is an elf priestess of Tymora inside 
	- If we want good luck we pray to Tymora (casino time)
	- She is Sister Garaele 
- We walk by the Sleeping Giant 
	- It looks rundown as fuck 
- We go to the manor 
	- A lot of damage
	- Numerous jackals roam around the courtyard area 
	- They attack 
	- One of the jackals was wearing a pouch 
		- It had magic 
		- Beef killed it in one hit (womp womp)
		- None of us have good enough arcana to tell what was going on with it 
	- They start to run (we dont chase)
	- Beef opens the satchel and finds 50 gp and a potion of climbing 
- We search the manor 
	- Some newly built structures around (2 are standing, all have been struck by fire)
	- Original stonework looks like its been crumbling for a while 
	- New stonework that has been destroyed 
	- Start digging through the rubble 
		- Find human remains (snacked on by jackals)
		- No intact bodies 
		- A symbol in chalk that is written on the walls 
			- Dran Enterprise Insignia 
				![[Pasted image 20260117174113.png]]
		- Find 70 rations, 2 explorers packs, 1 dungeoneer pack 
		- We hear pained moaning from a pile of rocks(not the fun kind)
		-
