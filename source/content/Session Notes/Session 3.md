- We enter Phandalin (3rd week of employment) and see some sort of stage set up with a large group around it 
- They are RACIST and say that we must be murderers based on just seeing us (apparently adventurers have not been good to this town)
- They are debating for the spot of mayor
- They finish up their debate and we go to find Sildar (the not racist one)
	- We talk to him and he says how Harbin (the racist one) owns a lot of land in the area 
	- Says how Halia went missing which caused the government to change to a council of 5 and a mayor 
	- The other Acq Inc franchise (Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose) moved in a while ago and were operating out of the Tresendar Manor 
		- About a week ago seemed to be some sort of fight going on (explosions, fighting, etc) and the manor was up in flames 
		- Didn't see who was fighting 
		- The town is not very happy with adventures 
		- He walked up there after a couple days and only found rubble, blood, scorch marks, and remnants of what they had been building 
	- The mines are currently down because of monster attacks. Harbin likes to blame the monster attacks on adventurers 
- We look at the Shrine of Luck 
	- There is an elf priestess of Tymora inside 
	- If we want good luck we pray to Tymora (casino time)
	- She is Sister Garaele 
- We walk by the Sleeping Giant 
	- It looks rundown as fuck 
- We go to the manor 
	- A lot of damage
	- Numerous jackals roam around the courtyard area 
	- They attack 
	- One of the jackals was wearing a pouch 
		- It had magic 
		- Beef killed it in one hit (womp womp)
		- None of us have good enough arcana to tell what was going on with it 
	- They start to run (we dont chase)
	- Beef opens the satchel and finds 50 gp and a potion of climbing 
- We search the manor 
	- Some newly built structures around (2 are standing, all have been struck by fire)
	- Original stonework looks like its been crumbling for a while 
	- New stonework that has been destroyed 
	- Start digging through the rubble 
		- Find human remains (snacked on by jackals)
		- No intact bodies 
		- A symbol in chalk that is written on the walls 
			- Dran Enterprise Insignia 
				![[Pasted image 20260117174113.png]]
		- Find 70 rations, 2 explorers packs, 1 dungeoneer pack 
		- We hear pained moaning from a pile of rocks (not the fun kind)
			- A faily injured half orc (still alive somehow) was under the rocks 
				- She is trying to say something but its incoherent 
				- Medicine check: probably been stuck under the rocks for a week, very thirsty and hungry 
				- Has something in her mouth 
					- Device that looks like it is similar to the magic clock (one of the missing pieces)
- We rest to give the half orc some time to get better 
	- We talk to her 
		- She was part of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose
		- They were attacked in the middle of the night (fireball, weapons, etc)
		- Saw one of the franchise members (Talanatha) use the Timepiece of Travel to teleport out
		- The Timepiece of Travel was left behind 
		- The half orc stuck the item in her mouth and then the building collapsed 
- There is a staircase that goes to the basement 
	- We notice a weak spot in the wall (where the wall was badly bricked up)
	- We open a door to a storage room 
		- Glorkho notices that there are weird orange things that are set up to drop if you move the crates 
		- We disarm the traps and search through the crates
- We go into the room that was found past the bricks 
	- There is a big pit in the floor
	- Hanging from nooses about the pit are two humanoid figures; White clothes with a purple hood
		- We throw a rock at one of the bodies 
			- Nothing happened 
		- No dust on the bodies 
		- No rotting smell 
		- Seem to be relatively new 
		- Beef gets somewhat close and the body attacks 
			- We kill them 
			- There head is a large stone with the draconic symbol on it 
			- Looks like there is a bunch of broken glass in the pit 
- Liri looks at the next room and finds some smashed coffins and a small intact one; Humanoid bones are across the floor 
	- The small intact one tries to attack Tarp when he opens it (mimic time)
	- The bones start to rattle 
	- We kill it (bro didnt even get a turn) and notice that there are wires that go to the bones that caused them to rattle 
- There were two doors, one locked and another unlocked
	- Liri picked the lock on the locked one and we found some cells 
		- One dragonborn prisoner was dead 
		- There are two half elf women in there who are weakly asking for help 
			- We pick that lock and let them out 
		- We give the women some food and water 
			- Abella Splitfig (one of the half elves) says that they were visiting the manor 
			- They collect herbs and spell components to sell
			- They were coming to see if they could work out a deal with the franchise when they got attacked 
				- They were trying to hide when the dragonborn found them 
				- The dragonborn (Drahkso) refused to kill them so they were thrown in prison too 
	- We opened the dragonborn door and it came alive and tried to kill us 
		- We kill it and loot the body 
			- The body doesnt have anything of use on it 
			- We search the room 4 plat coins (15 gp each)
			- 3 glass vials 
				- 2 potions of healing 
				- 1 potion of animal friendship 
- We head into the next room 
	- We found a hallway with one door and a secret 
	- Secret door
		- A bunch of corpses 
		- Runes on the wall that end abruptly 
		- Room smells real bad 
	- Pick the lock on the locked door 
		- Small room is "breath takingly" empty
- We go back into the death room 
	- Liri looks at the runes
		- The runes look like they are part of a ritual to open a portal (probably scary chaos dimension)
	- Bodies were probably sacrificed to try and power the portal but something went wrong 
		- Bodies seem to be about a week or so old 
		- Hard to tell age because of them being consumed by the ritual 
	- Continue onward into the death room 
		- Walls and supports are crumbling 
		- Two wooden bridges go across a large crack in the floor 
		- We search the room and some bugs crawl out of the crack and attack 
		- The bug fuck our shit (Liri and Beef are fine) so we go long rest 
- Continue further into the death room 
	- First door 
		- A table sits in the corner. Under it are some corpses that are naked except for colorful tights 
			- Could potentially be circus performers or boxer (some sort of performer)
			- They look decently strong
			- Cause of death seems to be execution (neck sliced)
		- On their chest is the dragon head symbol
		- We burn the corpses and enter the room, some shadows enter from under another door 
		- We kill them but i HATE everything (Beef keeps beefing it beefily)
		- Locked door in that room (fuck my life)
			- Pick the lock 
			- There is a bed and a desk in the room 
			- Looks clean 
			- Crumpled up pieces of paper under the desk 
				- Covered in ink blots 
				- Looks like it was under a piece of paper that was written on 
				- "S— We have completed our work here. Omin's moppets have been defeated, although the half-orc and the tiefling escaped. We believe the former ran for the woods, which means she will be ours soon enough. The latter, we cannot locate. We could not find the timepiece either, and it is possible the tiefling took it with her. However, if its magic functions as erratically as does that of the far gear, there may be more searching to be done. Everything goes according to plan, and the manor should be free to claim. Loose ends are being tied up as I write this. I am, always, your obliging servant, Hoobur"
				- At the bottom of the paper is the dragon head symbol 
			- Secret door 
				- Stairs going up back into the death room 
	- Second Door
		- A 5ft diameter circle of dark energy crackles in the corner 
		- The walls are etched with runes written in blood and charcoal 
		- The runes pulse at the same rhythm as the circle 
		- Similar to runes in the death room 
		- Some monster comes out of the circle of dark energy (portal)
		- The creature looks like a giant pile of flesh with a bunch of eyes on it; Pulsing in the same way as the runes the the portal 
		- We fight it
			- We kill it 
		- We scratch up the runes to close the portal 
	- Third Door 
		- Locked but Liri picked it 
		- Try to peak it but it wont open (hitting something)
		- Dabshabah and Beef force the door open 
		- A stone grinding noise happen as they open the door 
		- A stone statue of a kobold with no base was in front of the door
		- Some undead birds come from under the bed and attack 
			- They can turn things to stone (rip kobold)
			- We killed them 
		- Nothing except beds in the room 
	- Hallway Time 
		- Goes back to starting room 
- Tarp shows minor signs of racism yet again. Said that Liri would be comfortable sleeping in the death room 
- Something gross at the bottom of the water 
	- Some sort of dead decaying creature
	- We remove the creature and hopefully the water cycles to be clean again
- We long rest
- We go to leave below the manor
- We come face to face with two hobgoblins 
	- One wears an oversized tank on her back with a hose
		- Acid was coming out of the tank 
	- Both have the brand of Dran Enterprises 
	- Tarp is racist yet again "They *would* hire hobgoblins"
	- Tarp was punished for racism by being made BALD BALD
