- We enter Phandalin and see some sort of stage set up with a large group around it 
- They are RACIST and say that we must be murderers based on just seeing us (apparently adventurers have not been good to this town)
- They are debating for the spot of mayor
- They finish up their debate and we go to find Sildar (the not racist one)
	- We talk to him and he says how Harbin (the racist one) owns a lot of land in the area 
	- Says how Halia went missing which caused the government to change to a council of 5 and a mayor
