- We enter Phandalin (3rd week of employment) and see some sort of stage set up with a large group around it 
- They are RACIST and say that we must be murderers based on just seeing us (apparently adventurers have not been good to this town)
- They are debating for the spot of mayor
- They finish up their debate and we go to find Sildar (the not racist one)
	- We talk to him and he says how Harbin (the racist one) owns a lot of land in the area 
	- Says how Halia went missing which caused the government to change to a council of 5 and a mayor 
	- The other Acq Inc franchise (Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose) moved in a while ago and were operating out of the Tresendar Manor 
		- About a week ago seemed to be some sort of fight going on (explosions, fighting, etc) and the manor was up in flames 
		- Didn't see who was fighting 
		- The town is not very happy with adventures 
		- He walked up there after a couple days and only found rubble, blood, scorch marks, and remnants of what they had been building 
	- The mines are currently down because of monster attacks. Harbin likes to blame the monster attacks on adventurers 
- We look at the Shrine of Luck 
	- There is an elf priestess of Tymora inside 
	- If we want good luck we pray to Tymora (casino time)
	- She is Sister Garaele 
- We walk by the Sleeping Giant 
	- It looks rundown as fuck 
- We go to the manor 
	- A lot of damage
	-
