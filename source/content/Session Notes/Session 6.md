- We learn more about the Hall of Knowledge 
	- The vault is called the Vault of Tomes 
	- Vault is full of a lot of dangerous books 
- We went to rest at an inn and then headed to the Hall of Knowledge 
- We see someone who looks like he is probably the leader and he seems to be having an argument with a dwarf construction worker 
	- Liri goes to sneak closer to hear what they are saying 
	- The dwarf says shes done with this and she is leaving 
	- She throws her tools at his feet and the construction people leave 
		- She flips him off as well 
- We decide to go chat with the construction workers 
	- They gave an initial appraisal and later the guy kept having them redo stuff or adding things onto it 
	- Her name is Kollette
- We leave them and go back to the library 
- We go to talk to the leader guy (Leithennson)
	- He's a bitch 
	- He glares at us 
	- We mention how it looks like he is having a tough day 
	- He is upset that he needs to find a new construction crew 
	- We say that we could help him with that 
		- They need to be somewhat respected 
		- He gives us a general description of the work and how much they will be paid
- We go to search for some more construction workers 
	- There are many guilds to choose from, we pick one and go to see them 
	- We find one guild that seems to be willing to negotiate to work for them 
- We bring a representative back to Leithennson and they go to his office to negotiate 
	- After a while they are done with their negotiations and they don't look too mad 
	- They have managed to work out a deal 
- We ask for access to the Vault of Tomes 
	- We say that we are working for Acquisitions Incorporated and are researching a dangerous artifact 
	- He believes us and we are given access to the Vault 
- We go down to the Vault 
	- Liri searches for the book Oppal was talking about while Tarp goes to look for information on the Timepiece
	- Liri finds the book 
	- Tarp finds the names of two other components
		- Rotor of Return: seems to have the ability to teleport objects or allow the user to teleport
		- Dimensional Loop: seems to allow the user to warp space (teleporting-ish wormhole shit)
- We get the stuff and head out
- We head back to Phandelin
	- Oman was there and we gave him the book
	- We finished the quest yippee

- Tarp asks Oman if they found the tiefling who teleported away 
	- Another franchise has gone dark 
	- They haven't found the tiefling woman
	- They don't know anything about the dragon skull symbol
- The Order of the Stout Half-Pint is the organization that has gone dark 
	- Franchise of gnomes and halflings 
		- Tarp is racist again (Gorkoh would be able to rule over them because he's also short)
	- Oman wants us to look into this franchise 
	- North of Neverwinter 
- Downtime 
	- Tarp does an event and causes our monthly cost to reduce by 20% for two months 
	- Liri does more shady business and makes another 100gp 
		- Minor benefit: Word is spreading about how good the business is (+1 to all checks next time Liri tries it)
