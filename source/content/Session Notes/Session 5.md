- We head to Neverwinter
- Tarp asks the Timepiece where Harbin's money is kept 
	- Leads to the Hall of Justive in the Protector's Enclave 
	- Big government building 
	- Well protected, utilized as a bank 
- Tarp is racist yet again 
	- Wants to explode Gorkho even though he's done nothing wrong 
- We buy a Driftglobe and Horn of Blasting from a magic shop in Neverwinter
- We then go to find the person at the tavern that we are searching for
- Tarp asks the Timepiece Oppal's location and finds out that she is at the castle 
	- We decide to wait 
- Someone is staring at us
	- Likely wants something we have or something we know 
	- We go over to talk to her
	- She looks suspicious 
- Tarp immediately says who we are 
- Her name is Moguhl and she says she wants to talk to us outside 
	- She is also interested in finding Oppal
- We talk to her for a bit and she tells us to come with her
	- We say no and some bandits attack us

- 1 hand crossbow 
- 1 short sword (piercer)
- 23gp 
- Spell scroll of distort value 
- We find signs that they are part of the thieves guild 
- She was apparently a wererat 
- We talk to the bartender about it and give him 17gp for the trouble 
- We also talk to the guards and they agree that it was self defense and let us go 
- We had knocked one of the thieves out and buried him in the ground outside Neverwinter to interrogate him
	- They were hoping we would have info on Oppal
	- Oppal got arrested in the Neverwinter castle 
	- Got arrested for murdering someone (she didn't do it)
	- She was shape-changed into someone when that person did a murder so she got pinned for the crime 
	- The person was an orc 
		- Victim was some wealthy 
	- They were trying to find her because she has worked with the Thieves' Guild to sell things without the authorities knowing about it (avoiding taxes)
	- Were hoping to find out where she was keeping all that money 
	- Prison is under the Neverwinter Castle
		- The castle is under construction but the prison is still intact
		- Typically holds the worst criminals (murderers, tax evaders, etc)
	- Everyone in there is on death row 
	- Executions are typically in the town square 
	- A lot of people are at those executions
- Execution is in three days
- We go to the thieves guld
	- Murderer: Gargak
	- Hired by Zrhentaim
	- Victim: Elf named Selanar Falaer
	- Extorsion gone wrong
	- As of 2 days he was still in the city
		- They were at a warehouse outside the chasm 
- Tarp uses the Timepiece to find where Gargak is, he is at the same warehouse still 
- Liri tried to stealth look through the window and got seen 
	- Some people came out of the warehouse and started to look for Liri 
	- They found her but she managed to talk her way out of it by convincing them that she was not sent by anyone and was just curious and looking around (claimed that she grew up in the woods and didn't know that looking at other peoples' property was considered bad)
- Used sending to talk to Oppal in prison
	- Gargak is red and has a scar over his eye
- We go talk to the guards to get permission to "talk" to the guy (likely will turn violent)
- Get brought to talk to Captain Mordra
- They deputize us and allow us to go check out the warehouse 
	- They would prefer us killing less people 
- Tarp is racist yet again 
	- Wants Gargak to work for him because of "how he looks"
- Tarp went to talk to them while Liri waited on a nearby roof
	- He called Gargak ugly and a fight started
- We captured Gargak and brought him into the city guard's interrogation area 
	- His boss' name is Zarena 
	- Doesn't know where she is going since the warehouse is down
	- Zarena demanded that Selanar give them a cut of profits for protection and they didn't pay up
	- The Zhentarim doesn't take kindly to people messing with them 
- We go talk to the captain about how we caught the actual murderer
	- We have to go talk to the magistrate about it 
	- We go do that 
	- Gargark confesses that it was him that did the crime 
- Oppal gets released and we talk to her

	- Under no circumstances should you open the book for your own safety 
	- The vault is a pretty secure location with a really fancy lock
