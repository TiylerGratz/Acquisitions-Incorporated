- We head to Neverwinter
- Tarp asks the Timepiece where Harbin's money is kept 
	- Leads to the Hall of Justive in the Protector's Enclave 
	- Big government building 
	- Well protected, utilized as a bank 
- Tarp is racist yet again 
	- Wants to explode Gorkho even though he's done nothing wrong 
- We buy a Driftglobe and Horn of Blasting from a magic shop in Neverwinter
- We then go to find the person at the tavern that we are searching for
- Tarp asks the Timepiece Oppal's location and finds out that she is at the castle 
	- We decide to wait 
- Someone is staring at us
	- Likely wants something we have or something we know 
	- We go over to talk to her
	- She looks suspicious 
- Tarp immediately says who we are 
- Her name is Moguhl and she says she wants to talk to us outside 
	- She is also interested in finding Oppal
- We talk to her for a bit and she tells us to come with her
	- We say no and some bandits attack us
	- We kill them pretty easily 
- 5 scimitars 
- 5 light crossbows 
- 1 hand crossbow 
- 1 short sword (piercer)
- 23gp 
- Spell scroll of distort value 
- We find signs that they are part of the thieves guild 
- She was apparently a wererat 
- We talk to the bartender about it and give him 17gp for the trouble 
- We also talk to the guards and they agree that it was self defense and let us go 
- We had knocked one of the thieves out and buried him in the ground outside Neverwinter to interrogate him
	- They were hoping we would have info on Oppal
	- Oppal got arrested in the Neverwinter castle 
	- Got arrested for murdering someone (she didn't do it)
	- She was shape-changed into someone when that person did a murder so she got pinned for the crime 
	- The person was an orc 
		- Victim was some wealthy 
	- They were trying to find her because she has worked with the Thieves' Guild to sell things without the authorities knowing about it (avoiding taxes)
	- Were hoping to find out where she was keeping all that money 
	- Prison is under the Neverwinter Castle
		- The castle is under construction but the prison is still intact
		- Typically holds the worst criminals (murderers, tax evaders, etc)
	- Everyone in there is on death row 
	- Executions are typically in the town square 
	- A lot of people are at those executions
- Execution is in three days
